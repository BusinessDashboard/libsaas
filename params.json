{"name":"Libsaas","body":"This is libsaas, a library to take the pain out of using SaaS APIs.\r\n\r\nIt provides an abstraction layer on top of various APIs, taking care of\r\nconstructing the URLs, serializing parameters and authentication. You just call\r\nPython methods and receive Python objects.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom libsaas.services import zendesk\r\n\r\nservice = zendesk.Zendesk('myapp', 'myuser', 's3cr3t')\r\njoe = service.users().search('joe@example.org')['users'][0]\r\njoes_tickets = service.user(joe['id']).tickets_requested()\r\n\r\nfor ticket in joes_tickets:\r\n    print(ticket['description'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck out more examples in the [usage docs](http://libsaas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/).
